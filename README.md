# Phantom Pain

Hey! This is a presentation repo _plus_ a tech-demo of all the cool stuff you can do with the power of React and Puppeteer!

## ðŸ’» Installation

1. Be sure NodeJS @ 8.x.x is installed since we like those `async|await` operations.
2. Install the deps: `yarn || npm i`.
3. Start dev server for slides: `npm start`.

## ðŸŽ‰ The _other_ fun stuff

This is a showcase for puppeteer's awesome abillities to integrate with a React project, so there's some fun stuff (make sure you have the site running!)

1. Capture Screenshots with: `npm run screenshot`.
2. Build a more elaborate index.html file with `npm run index`.
3. Run E2E style tests with `npm test`.
